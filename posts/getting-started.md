# Getting Started

Welcome to my blog! This is a simple blog framework built with React and Vite, inspired by Hexo.

## Features

This blog framework includes:

- Clean, minimal design
- Responsive layout
- Tag system for categorizing posts
- Archive page for browsing by date
- Project showcase section
- Dark and light mode support

## Getting Started

To add a new post, create a markdown file in the `posts/` directory:

```bash
npm run new "My New Post"
```

Each post should have frontmatter with:
- **title**: The post title
- **date**: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **tags**: Array of tag strings
- **excerpt**: Short description for previews

## Customization

You can customize the theme by editing the `_config.yml` file. The color scheme, fonts, and spacing can all be adjusted to match your personal style.

Happy blogging!
